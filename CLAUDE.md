# CLAUDE.md — Forever Voiceover

Notes for agents working in this repo. Read this before touching anything.

## What this is

Voiced quests and NPC dialogue for **World of Warcraft: Forever** (the
Classic-plus client, codename Camelot). Two addons plus a Python pipeline:

- `ForeverVO/` — the player addon. Lua, Retail-engine APIs only, no libraries.
- `ForeverVO_Data/` — the voice pack (generated Lua tables + mp3s). Only the
  tables are in git; the audio lives on the maintainer's machine and ships as
  a separate zip.
- `tools/` — capture ingestion, bulk text sources, voice reference building,
  Chatterbox TTS generation, pack table writer, packaging helpers.
- `captures/` — community `/fvo export` submissions, committed by a GitHub
  Action from comments on the pinned issue #1.

Owner: Quinn Dougherty (quinn@for-all.dev). CurseForge projects: addon 1705010,
delta pack 1705094, base pack 1705100 (IDs in tools/config.py; API key only in the gitignored .env). Addon
slug `forever-vo`, display name "Forever Voiceover". License MIT; voice packs
are non-commercial fan content (Blizzard's text, voices cloned from the
game's own recordings).

## The client, and why so much is unusual

- Product `wow_classic_beta`, version 1.60.1, **Interface 16001**, TOC suffix
  `_Camelot`. It runs the **Retail engine** (`WOW_PROJECT_ID ==
  WOW_PROJECT_MAINLINE`) with Classic data. Port from Retail code paths, never
  from Classic ones.
- Blizzard's UI source for this exact build is in the Gethe mirror, branch
  `forever` (`github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-source`). A sparse checkout was used
  at `~/Projects/wow-ui-source`. Check there before assuming an API or frame
  exists. Camelot-specific overrides live in `*/Camelot/` folders.
- `docs/forever_api.json` is a captured list of the client's global
  functions, frames and `C_*` namespaces. `uv run tools/apicheck.py` diffs
  the addon against it. Run it after any Lua change.
- Removed globals that bite: `MouseIsOver` (use `frame:IsMouseOver()`),
  `SetDesaturation` (use `texture:SetDesaturated()`),
  `InterfaceOptions_AddCategory` (use the Settings API),
  `GetGossipText` (use `C_GossipInfo.GetText()`). `GameTooltip:SetText`
  rejects the old 6-argument form.
- **Saved variables are written on logout/reload but never read back** on
  this beta. Every session starts from defaults. Consequences: settings reset
  each login (that is why the unvoiced-line reminders are on by default), the
  welcome popup's "seen" flag lives in an addon-registered CVar instead, and
  the capture only ever holds one session, so it is ingested on every write.
- The addon compartment exists in the code but does not show on the Camelot
  minimap skin, hence our own minimap button.
- Quest and gossip **text is not in the client files**. The server sends it.
  Client tables on wago.tools (`QuestV2`, `BroadcastText`) carry no usable
  text. Text comes only from: in-game capture, the client's own quest cache
  (`Cache/WDB/enUS/questcache.wdb`, offers only), and the open Classic
  database snapshot (VMaNGOS, for unchanged Classic content).

## Addon conventions

- Every file starts `local _, ns = ...`; only `ForeverVO` (the namespace) and
  the three compartment handlers are globals. Modules register with
  `ns.OnInit`/`ns.OnLogin`.
- UI follows Blizzard's own frames: the talking head is a rebuild of
  `TalkingHeadFrame` (same atlases, anchors, animations); buttons use
  `UIPanelButtonTemplate`; options use `Settings.RegisterAddOnSetting` and
  friends; the internal playback queue is a `CallbackRegistryMixin`.
  There is no separate queue window or manual reordering UI in this fork.
  Keep that discipline: no embedded libraries, native look.
- Voice pack format is documented at the top of `ForeverVO/Core/Packs.lua`.
  Quests are keyed by ID and event with durations; gossip by speaker key
  (creature ID, negative for game objects) plus a text hash, with a Jaccard
  fuzzy fallback.
- **The text hash must stay identical in Lua and Python**:
  `Util.Tokenize`/`Util.NormalizeText`/`Util.HashText` in `Core/Util.lua` and
  `tools/textkey.py`. If you touch one, touch the other and re-test with
  `nix shell nixpkgs#lua5_1 -c ./tools/run.sh tools/textkey_parity.py`, which
  runs both over the real captures, the tokenised quest cache and edge cases.
- **The client expands `$n`, `$c` and `$r` before any addon sees the text.** A
  line first heard on a rogue would otherwise be recorded saying "rogue" and
  voiced that way for everyone, and its gossip hash would only match other
  rogues. `Util.Tokenize` puts the placeholders back at capture time (capture
  version 3 also records the reader's class and race), `FindGossip` tokenises
  the live text before hashing, and `NormalizeText` drops the placeholders on
  both sides so one recording matches every class. `LEGACY_CHARACTERS` in
  `tools/config.py` covers captures made before version 3; `ingest.py` re-runs
  the reversal on every ingest, which is idempotent.
- **Ingest repairs two ways Tokenize goes wrong**, in the same idempotent pass
  (`repair_entry`: tokenize, un-glue, reconcile). Addon releases before the
  whole-word fix tokenised inside words (`w$nh`, `$Cs`), and a placeholder
  touching a letter or digit is treated as corruption: the literal word is put
  back when the reader is known, otherwise the entry is dropped so the line
  gets re-captured. Community exports carry no name, class or race, so
  `COMMUNITY_CHARACTERS` in `tools/config.py` maps an export's `origin` (the
  issue comment id, stamped on each entry at ingest) to what the poster said;
  `restoreName` marks a name that is an ordinary word ("It"), whose every `$n`
  is put back. Tokenize also cannot tell a Mage's expanded `$c` from a literal
  "mage", so where the raw text is known (`bulk/questcache.json` by quest key,
  `bulk/classic.json` gossip by speaker, closest line) a capture placeholder
  that aligns to a plain word there is restored to that word; the alignment
  must score 0.9 or better, so lines Forever rewrote are left alone. Only the
  placeholders are reconciled; the capture's text otherwise wins. Two readers
  of different class or race who capture the same quest also settle it in
  `merge_entry` (gossip keys differ by hash, so that only helps quests).
- `luac -p` every changed Lua file (`nix shell nixpkgs#lua5_1 -c luac -p`).
  There is no in-game test harness; the owner tests by `/reload`.

## Pipeline (tools/)

Scripts carry inline `# /// script` metadata and run with `uv run`.
`tools/run.sh` wraps that and, on NixOS, supplies Python, uv, ffmpeg and the
shared libraries CUDA wheels need. Use `./tools/run.sh tools/<x>.py`.

Data flow (all JSON is the source of truth; `ForeverVO_Data/Data/*.lua` is a
build artifact, never hand-edited):

1. `ingest.py` merges `WTF/Account/*/SavedVariables/ForeverVO.lua` and
   `captures/*.json` into `tools/data/capture.json`.
2. `classicdb.py` exports the VMaNGOS SQLite snapshot to
   `tools/data/bulk/classic.json` (ignored, 7 MB, regenerable).
   `wdbcache.py` decodes the beta quest cache to `bulk/questcache.json`
   (versioned). Precedence when merging: capture > questcache > classic.
3. `generate.py` picks a voice per speaker, synthesises with Chatterbox on the
   GPU, writes mp3s under `ForeverVO_Data/Sounds/`, rebuilds the tables every
   25 files, and records the voice (`v`) and a hash of the spoken text (`t`)
   per file in `sound_index.json`, so a file is regenerated when its resolved
   voice changes (e.g. a guessed Skyborne male giver turns out female once
   captured) or when the text itself is corrected — a quest file keeps its
   `<questID>-<event>` name, so nothing else would notice. Entries written
   before `t` existed have none and are left alone rather than all regenerated.
   Narrator lines (quests and gossip from objects, items and speakers with no
   gender) are generated once per voice in `config.NARRATOR_VOICES`: the first
   entry is the default and keeps the plain path and `sound_index` key, the
   rest go to `Sounds/<Quests|Gossip>/Narrator/<voice>/` with
   `Narrator/<voice>/<base>` as their index key. The addon needs each
   alternate's own duration, so quests get `Data/Narrator.lua`
   (`pack.narrator`, indexed into `pack.narratorVoices`) and gossip entries get
   an `n` field indexed the same
   way. Alternates sort last in the todo list, so a time-boxed run still spends
   its GPU on unvoiced lines; `--narrator-only` / `--narrator-voices` control a
   dedicated pass.
4. `build_voice_references.py` makes cloning clips under `tools/voices/`
   from the client's own audio via wago.tools: race voices from shared NPC
   greeting kits, Skyborne from `VocalUISounds`, and `--named` for NPCs whose
   greeting kit is theirs alone (Varimathras, Thrall, Sylvanas, ...).
   `wowdata.voice_for_npc` prefers `npc-<displayID>.wav`, then race+gender
   from `CreatureDisplayInfoExtra` via the display ID, then the same via the
   captured `modelFileID` (`CreatureModelData` -> the display rows using that
   model, majority vote narrowed by UnitSex and the zone hint), then zone
   hints, then narrator.

Voice quality notes: Chatterbox on an RTX 3080 does ~6 s of audio in ~5 s
with the game closed, roughly 3x slower with it open. Perth (the watermarker)
needs `setuptools<81`. Text cleaning rules mirror the original VoiceOver
tool (`$B` newlines, `$N`/`$C`/`$R` substitutions, `$G` gender branches as
m-/f- file variants, angle-bracket stage directions stripped).

## Automation on the owner's machine (NixOS, systemd user units)

Installed by `tools/install-timer.sh`:

- `forever-vo-ingest.path` — fires on every write of the saved-variables
  file; runs `tools/ingest.sh` = pull, ingest, push `capture.json`.
- `forever-vo-daily.timer` — 04:00 nightly: sync, voice captured lines,
  work the bulk backlog for 2 h, rebuild tables, commit and push.
- `forever-vo-bulk.service` — the long bulk run, `Restart=on-failure` so a
  CUDA context lost to suspend just resumes (existing files are skipped).
  `WantedBy=default.target` (since 2026-09-21), so a reboot resumes it on its
  own; `Restart=on-failure` only covers a crash while running, not a reboot.
  Because it is then normally up at 04:00, `daily.sh` stops it for the duration
  of the nightly run and restarts it from an `EXIT` trap — it used to just
  bail out, which would have skipped the captured pass, the table rebuild and
  the delta upload for as long as bulk stayed up. It runs `tools/bulk.sh`,
  which starts `FOREVER_VO_WORKERS` (default 2) `generate.py --shard i/N`
  processes: one autoregressive stream leaves the GPU about 60% idle, and on
  the 3080 two together measured 2.59x realtime against 1.68x for one, while
  three were no better than two and crowd the 16 GB. Set
  `FOREVER_VO_WORKERS=1` to give the GPU back to the game.

Do not add a periodic pull timer; the owner declined it. Parallel *shards* are
fine — `sound_index.json` is re-read and merged before every write, and the
pack tables are written through a temporary file and renamed, so neither is
torn by two writers. Two *unsharded* generators are still wrong: they would
walk the same todo list and race for the same files.

## Releases

Three CurseForge projects, three release paths:

- **Addon** (1705010, slug `forever-vo`): `.pkgmeta` at the root uses
  `move-folders` so only `ForeverVO/` ships. Push a `v*` tag: the GitHub
  workflow builds a release with the BigWigs packager, and CurseForge's own
  packager (repo linked as Source, tags only) publishes the same zip. Do
  **not** set the `CF_API_KEY` GitHub *secret*, or files upload twice. (The
  same name in the local `.env` is a different thing and *must* be set: that
  one is for the voice packs, below. Repo secret unset, `.env` set.)
  `CHANGELOG.md` is the release notes. The packager's own dry run
  (`release.sh -d -g 1.60.1`, needs zip, unzip, pandoc) is no longer practical
  here: it walks the whole working tree, and `ForeverVO_Data/Sounds/` now holds
  thousands of mp3s, so it hangs in `find` for many minutes. CI never hits this
  because the mp3s are gitignored and the checkout has no audio. The TOC carries
  `## X-Curse-Project-ID`; the packager maps Interface 16001 to game version
  "1.60.1" itself, there is no version field to fill.
- **Delta pack** "Forever Voiceover Data: Forever" (1705094): lines whose
  source is not `classic` (captures, community, beta cache), priority 200.
  `tools/release_pack.py delta --upload --if-changed` runs at the end of the
  nightly job and uploads a dated beta when the file set changed.
- **Base pack** "Forever Voiceover Data: Base" (1705100): the Classic-sourced
  lines, priority 100, huge (~1.5 GB re-encoded), released by hand and
  rarely: `tools/release_pack.py base --upload`.

`release_pack.py` builds from the single working folder `ForeverVO_Data`
(which holds everything on the owner's machine and is what the client loads
locally), re-encodes to mono 48 kbps mp3 under `tools/data/release/`, writes
a fresh manifest per pack (`<Folder>Pack` global, `Register.lua`), and
uploads through the CurseForge upload API (`wow.curseforge.com/api`). Pack
versions are date based (`2026.09.20`, `.2` on the same day) and tracked in
`tools/data/release_state.json`. Project IDs are the `CURSEFORGE_PROJECTS`
constant in `tools/config.py`; the API key is `CF_API_KEY` in the
gitignored `.env`, read by `load_dotenv()` in `release_pack.py`
(`CURSEFORGE_API_KEY` is still accepted; it was renamed 2026-09-21 to match
the packager's name). This is the local file, not the GitHub secret of the
same name, which stays unset — see the addon entry above.

CurseForge moderation holds new projects and their first files for a day or
so; nothing needs doing meanwhile. The project logo must be original art
(`docs/logo.svg` / `logo.png`); Blizzard icons are fine inside the client but
rejected as a storefront logo.

## Crowdsourcing

`/fvo export` packs a session's unvoiced lines (character name replaced by
`$n`) via `C_EncodingUtil` into an `FVO1:` string. Players paste it as a
comment on issue #1; `.github/workflows/ingest-captures.yml` decodes it with
`tools/exportfile.py` (stdlib only) into `captures/` and reacts with a rocket.
The owner's machine picks those up on the next sync.

## Gotchas already paid for

- A bash heredoc inside a Python heredoc terminates at the inner `EOF`. Use
  different terminators or the Write tool.
- `pkill -f 'tools/generate.py'` matches the shell that runs it; use
  `pgrep -f` to look and `systemctl --user stop forever-vo-bulk` to stop.
- A suspend can kill the GPU outright, not just the CUDA context: on
  2026-09-21 the resume logged `Xid 31` then `Xid 154, GPU recovery action
  changed to 0x2 (Node Reboot Required)`, and every later process got "CUDA
  unknown error" from `torch.cuda.is_available()` until a reboot. `nvidia-smi`
  still answers in that state, so it is not a good health check; the kernel log
  (`journalctl -k | grep Xid`) is. `generate.py` now refuses to run on the CPU
  unless `--cpu` is given, because the silent fallback is ~18x slower than real
  time and looks like a working run. The bulk unit holds a
  `systemd-inhibit --what=idle` lock, but that only stops logind's own idle
  action: GNOME's power plugin suspends on its own input-idle timer and never
  consults logind inhibitors, and it did exactly that on 2026-09-22 at 00:53
  (two hours after the last keypress, `sleep-inactive-ac-timeout` 7200) with
  the lock held, killing the GPU again. The fix is on the desktop side:
  `gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power
  sleep-inactive-ac-type 'nothing'` (set 2026-09-22; battery left at
  `suspend`). If a run dies at a round two-hour mark, check that setting first.
- The wago.tools CSV export is complete for client tables, but the beta's
  `BroadcastText` really is 12 rows; gossip is server-pushed on this engine.
- `questcache.wdb` records have a variable fixed part; `wdbcache.py` scans
  every offset and prefers the candidate with no objectives block. It parses
  all 258 records of the owner's cache and was validated against Classic
  titles.
- `PlayerModel:GetDisplayInfo()` returns 0 until the model loads; the capture
  reads it in `OnModelLoaded`, and the merge ignores zero display IDs. On the
  Forever client it never yields anything at all (0 of 146 captured NPCs), only
  `GetModelFileID()` does; the Classic export supplies display IDs for
  unchanged NPCs and the `modelFileID` fallback covers Forever-only ones. Several
  `CreatureModelData` rows can share one file (Jornah's 949470 has two), so the
  reverse index is keyed by model ID, not by file.
- `wowdata.voice_for_npc` once silently used an old field name
  (`isObjectOrItem`) and a patch whose anchor text had drifted never applied.
  After editing with search-and-replace, grep for the new text; do not trust
  "patched".
- Sound file names: quests are `<questID>-<event>`, gossip `<speaker>-<hash>`.
  Tell them apart by the last segment (`generate.sound_folder`), not by
  whether the first segment is numeric, since speaker keys are numeric too.
- Alternate narrator files keep the same base name and are told apart by their
  folder (`Quests/Narrator/<voice>/`, `Gossip/Narrator/<voice>/`), so anything
  that walks sounds by `glob("*/*.mp3")` (the two-level scan in
  `rebuild_tables`) misses them by design; they have their own scan and their
  own set in the stats (`narratorFiles`, paths relative to `Sounds/`).
- The bulk generator's `sound_index.json` is written every 25 files; the
  release script and the nightly table rebuild reload sources so files made
  by another run are still indexed.
- `uv run --with requests python -c ...` is the way to poke at `wowdata`
  from a one-liner; `run.sh python -c` gives a bare interpreter.
- CurseForge's public web API (`curseforge.com/api/v1/...`) returns HTML to
  scripts; the authenticated `wow.curseforge.com/api` is what works.
- The Forever client picks `_Camelot.toc` when present and `.toc` otherwise;
  this addon uses the plain `.toc` with Interface 16001.

## Voices

- Race voices: `tools/voices/<race>-<gender>.wav`, cloned from NPC greeting
  kits shared by many models. Skyborne from `VocalUISounds`
  (`NormalSoundID_0` male, `_1` female). Blood elf female has only ~7 s.
- Named NPCs: `npc-<displayID>.wav` for greeting kits used by 3 or fewer
  models (64 of them: Varimathras, Thrall, Sylvanas, Cairne...). Thrall has
  just two greetings, so his clone is rougher.
- `FALLBACK_VOICES` and `ZONE_RACE_HINTS` in `tools/config.py` cover races
  without a clip and speakers without display data (Zephras Isle -> skyborne).
- `--assume-voice` on `generate.py` voices cache-only quests whose giver is
  unknown (used once for Zephras Isle with `skyborne-male`); the voice-change
  check fixes them once a capture names the giver.
- `NARRATOR_VOICES` remains an upstream generation option. This fork always
  plays the default narration; it does not expose a narrator picker or read the
  old `ForeverVO_narratorVoice` CVar. Use `--narrator-voices none` for this fork.
- The talking head always uses quest parchment with dark body/title text.
  There is no background selector. NPC greetings and conversations always play
  when available; the internal queue deduplicates pending audio and gives quest
  dialogue priority. The old repeat-frequency and dialogue toggles are unused.

## Things the owner wants next

- Per-line configurability: let end users nudge text, voice, exaggeration or
  pacing for a line and re-run Chatterbox for it themselves.
- A Discord bot as an alternative inbox for `FVO1:` strings (same decoder).
- A first base pack release once the Classic bulk run finishes (it was at
  ~900 of ~7,900 quest files on 2026-09-20 evening; gossip follows quests).
- Lower bitrate for the base pack (32 kbps) if 1.5 GB proves too large for
  CurseForge or for players.
