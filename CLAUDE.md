# CLAUDE.md — Forever Voiceover

Notes for agents working in this repo. Read this before touching anything.

## What this is

Voiced quests and NPC dialogue for **World of Warcraft: Forever** (the
Classic-plus client, codename Camelot). Two addons plus a Python pipeline:

- `ForeverVO/` — the player addon. Lua, Retail-engine APIs only, no libraries.
- `ForeverVO_Data/` — the voice pack (generated Lua tables + mp3s). Only the
  tables are in git; the audio lives on the maintainer's machine and ships as
  a separate zip.
- `tools/` — capture ingestion, bulk text sources, voice reference building,
  Chatterbox TTS generation, pack table writer, packaging helpers.
- `captures/` — community `/fvo export` submissions, committed by a GitHub
  Action from comments on the pinned issue #1.

Owner: Quinn Dougherty (quinn@for-all.dev). CurseForge projects: addon 1705010,
delta pack 1705094, base pack 1705100 (IDs in tools/config.py; API key only in the gitignored .env). Addon
slug `forever-vo`, display name "Forever Voiceover". License MIT; voice packs
are non-commercial fan content (Blizzard's text, voices cloned from the
game's own recordings).

## The client, and why so much is unusual

- Product `wow_classic_beta`, version 1.60.1, **Interface 16001**, TOC suffix
  `_Camelot`. It runs the **Retail engine** (`WOW_PROJECT_ID ==
  WOW_PROJECT_MAINLINE`) with Classic data. Port from Retail code paths, never
  from Classic ones.
- Blizzard's UI source for this exact build is in the Gethe mirror, branch
  `forever` (`github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-source`). A sparse checkout was used
  at `~/Projects/wow-ui-source`. Check there before assuming an API or frame
  exists. Camelot-specific overrides live in `*/Camelot/` folders.
- `docs/forever_api.json` is a captured list of the client's global
  functions, frames and `C_*` namespaces. `uv run tools/apicheck.py` diffs
  the addon against it. Run it after any Lua change.
- Removed globals that bite: `MouseIsOver` (use `frame:IsMouseOver()`),
  `SetDesaturation` (use `texture:SetDesaturated()`),
  `InterfaceOptions_AddCategory` (use the Settings API),
  `GetGossipText` (use `C_GossipInfo.GetText()`). `GameTooltip:SetText`
  rejects the old 6-argument form.
- **Saved variables are written on logout/reload but never read back** on
  this beta. Every session starts from defaults. Consequences: settings reset
  each login (that is why the unvoiced-line reminders are on by default), the
  welcome popup's "seen" flag lives in an addon-registered CVar instead, and
  the capture only ever holds one session, so it is ingested on every write.
- The addon compartment exists in the code but does not show on the Camelot
  minimap skin, hence our own minimap button.
- Quest and gossip **text is not in the client files**. The server sends it.
  Client tables on wago.tools (`QuestV2`, `BroadcastText`) carry no usable
  text. Text comes only from: in-game capture, the client's own quest cache
  (`Cache/WDB/enUS/questcache.wdb`, offers only), and the open Classic
  database snapshot (VMaNGOS, for unchanged Classic content).

## Addon conventions

- Every file starts `local _, ns = ...`; only `ForeverVO` (the namespace) and
  the three compartment handlers are globals. Modules register with
  `ns.OnInit`/`ns.OnLogin`.
- UI follows Blizzard's own frames: the talking head is a rebuild of
  `TalkingHeadFrame` (same atlases, anchors, animations); buttons use
  `UIPanelButtonTemplate`; options use `Settings.RegisterAddOnSetting` and
  friends; the internal playback queue is a `CallbackRegistryMixin`.
  There is no separate queue window or manual reordering UI in this fork.
  Keep that discipline: no embedded libraries, native look.
- Voice pack format is documented at the top of `ForeverVO/Core/Packs.lua`.
  Quests are keyed by ID and event with durations; gossip by speaker key
  (creature ID, negative for game objects) plus a text hash, with a Jaccard
  fuzzy fallback.
- **The text hash must stay identical in Lua and Python**:
  `Util.Tokenize`/`Util.NormalizeText`/`Util.HashText` in `Core/Util.lua` and
  `tools/textkey.py`. If you touch one, touch the other and re-test with
  `nix shell nixpkgs#lua5_1 -c ./tools/run.sh tools/textkey_parity.py`, which
  runs both over the real captures, the tokenised quest cache and edge cases.
- **The client expands `$n`, `$c` and `$r` before any addon sees the text.** A
  line first heard on a rogue would otherwise be recorded saying "rogue" and
  voiced that way for everyone, and its gossip hash would only match other
  rogues. `Util.Tokenize` puts the placeholders back at capture time (capture
  version 3 also records the reader's class and race), `FindGossip` tokenises
  the live text before hashing, and `NormalizeText` drops the placeholders on
  both sides so one recording matches every class. `LEGACY_CHARACTERS` in
  `tools/config.py` covers captures made before version 3; `ingest.py` re-runs
  the reversal on every ingest, which is idempotent. Since addon 0.1.2 the
  name is matched case-sensitively (the client always renders it capitalised,
  so a lowercase match is the word, not the name) while class and race still
  fold case (`$c` renders "rogue", `$C` "Rogue"); both sides are ASCII-only
  on purpose, since Lua patterns cannot fold Unicode.
- **Ingest repairs two ways Tokenize goes wrong**, in the same idempotent pass
  (`repair_entry`: tokenize, un-glue, reconcile). Addon releases before the
  whole-word fix tokenised inside words (`w$nh`, `$Cs`), and a placeholder
  touching a letter or digit is treated as corruption: the literal word is put
  back when the reader is known, otherwise the entry is dropped so the line
  gets re-captured. Community exports carry no name, class or race, so
  `COMMUNITY_CHARACTERS` in `tools/config.py` maps an export's `origin` (the
  issue comment id, stamped on each entry at ingest) to what the poster said;
  `restoreName` marks a name that is an ordinary word ("It"), whose every `$n`
  is put back; for exports from addon 0.1.2 on (`addon` in the decoded file,
  stamped on each entry like `origin`) only `$N` is put back, since that addon
  can only have written the name capitalised. The glued check skips the `B`
  of a `$B` line break, or raw text (`$B$B$n`) would read as corruption.
  Tokenize also cannot tell a Mage's expanded `$c` from a literal
  "mage", so where the raw text is known (`bulk/questcache.json` by quest key,
  `bulk/classic.json` gossip by speaker, closest line) a capture placeholder
  that aligns to a plain word there is restored to that word; the alignment
  must score 0.9 or better, so lines Forever rewrote are left alone. Only the
  placeholders are reconciled; the capture's text otherwise wins. Two readers
  of different class or race who capture the same quest also settle it in
  `merge_entry` (gossip keys differ by hash, so that only helps quests).
- **The client resolves `$g lad:lass;` too, and one reader cannot reverse it**:
  the other branch is gone. Since addon 0.1.4 (capture version 4, export field
  `g`) the capture records the reader's sex, and ingest puts the branch back
  two ways, both idempotent: `restore_gender` hands the raw source text back
  when a capture is that text read as one sex (jhaubrich's #28), and
  `merge_gender` rebuilds `$g his:hers;` from a male and a female reading that
  differ only in short aligned runs (`rebuild_gender`: at most three branches
  of four words, alignment 0.6, no inserts). Identical readings settle the
  line with `sex: "mf"`; a later reading that no longer matches (Forever
  reworded the quest) outvotes a settled entry, so it is asked for again.
  `needs_of` records on each quest entry which readers are still wanted
  (`needs`: `f` after a male reading, `mf` when the reader is unknown, none
  when the text matches raw source text without a branch), `rebuild_tables`
  writes it as `wa`/`wp`/`wc` on the quest record, and the addon
  (`Packs:QuestWanted`, `Capture.Contributes`) captures and exports such a
  line even though it is voiced, with `wanted` set. That is the general hook
  for any later change in what a capture must carry: make `needs_of` ask and
  players re-supply the line; no hand-built exports, no sharing of
  `questcache.wdb` (the owner declined both on #29). Gossip stays resolved:
  it is keyed by a hash of the live text. Note that `release_pack.py
  --if-changed` fingerprints sound files only, so new `w*` markers reach
  players with the next delta that carries a new file. `./tools/run.sh
  tools/gender_check.py` runs fixed cases and Classic's quest 233 through all
  of it; run it after touching any of those functions.
- `luac -p` every changed Lua file (`nix shell nixpkgs#lua5_1 -c luac -p`).
  There is no in-game test harness; the owner tests by `/reload`.

## Pipeline (tools/)

Scripts carry inline `# /// script` metadata and run with `uv run`.
`tools/run.sh` wraps that and, on NixOS, supplies Python, uv, ffmpeg and the
shared libraries CUDA wheels need. Use `./tools/run.sh tools/<x>.py`.

Data flow (all JSON is the source of truth; `ForeverVO_Data/Data/*.lua` is a
build artifact, never hand-edited):

1. `ingest.py` merges `WTF/Account/*/SavedVariables/ForeverVO.lua` and
   `captures/*.json` into `tools/data/capture.json`.
2. `classicdb.py` exports the VMaNGOS SQLite snapshot to
   `tools/data/bulk/classic.json` (ignored, 7 MB, regenerable).
   `wdbcache.py` decodes the beta quest cache to `bulk/questcache.json`
   (versioned). Precedence when merging: capture > questcache > classic.
3. `generate.py` picks a voice per speaker, synthesises with Chatterbox on the
   GPU, writes mp3s under `ForeverVO_Data/Sounds/`, rebuilds the tables every
   25 files, and records the voice (`v`) and a hash of the spoken text (`t`)
   per file in `sound_index.json`, so a file is regenerated when its resolved
   voice changes (e.g. a guessed Skyborne male giver turns out female once
   captured) or when the text itself is corrected — a quest file keeps its
   `<questID>-<event>` name, so nothing else would notice. Entries written
   before `t` existed have none and are left alone rather than all regenerated.
   Narrator lines (quests and gossip from objects, items and speakers with no
   gender) are generated once per voice in `config.NARRATOR_VOICES`: the first
   entry is the default and keeps the plain path and `sound_index` key, the
   rest go to `Sounds/<Quests|Gossip>/Narrator/<voice>/` with
   `Narrator/<voice>/<base>` as their index key. The addon needs each
   alternate's own duration, so quests get `Data/Narrator.lua`
   (`pack.narrator`, indexed into `pack.narratorVoices`) and gossip entries get
   an `n` field indexed the same
   way. Alternates sort last in the todo list, so a time-boxed run still spends
   its GPU on unvoiced lines; `--narrator-only` / `--narrator-voices` control a
   dedicated pass.
4. `build_voice_references.py` makes cloning clips under `tools/voices/`
   from the client's own audio via wago.tools: race voices from shared NPC
   greeting kits, Skyborne from `VocalUISounds`, and `--named` for NPCs whose
   greeting kit is theirs alone (Varimathras, Thrall, Sylvanas, ...).
   `wowdata.voice_for_npc` prefers `npc-<displayID>.wav`, then race+gender
   from `CreatureDisplayInfoExtra` via the display ID, then the same via the
   captured `modelFileID` (`CreatureModelData` -> the display rows using that
   model, majority vote narrowed by UnitSex and the zone hint), then zone
   hints, then narrator.

Voice quality notes: Chatterbox on an RTX 3080 does ~6 s of audio in ~5 s
with the game closed, roughly 3x slower with it open. Perth (the watermarker)
needs `setuptools<81`. Text cleaning rules mirror the original VoiceOver
tool (`$B` newlines, `$N`/`$C`/`$R` substitutions, `$G` gender branches as
m-/f- file variants). Angle-bracket stage directions are the narrator's: a
speaker's whole-line file leaves them out, and the line also gets *parts*
(`textclean.segments`, `Item.variants().parts`), one file each in reading
order, `<questID>-p<i>-<event>` / `<speaker>-p<i>-<hash>`, the speaker's in
their voice and the stage directions in the narrator's (plus every alternate
narrator voice, under `Narrator/<voice>/`). The tables record them as
`aP`/`pP`/`cP` on the quest record, `P`/`nP` on a gossip entry and
`<letter>P` in the narrator table; the addon plays them back to back and
swaps in the chosen narrator. The whole-line file stays for older addons; a
line that is only a stage direction has parts and no whole-line file. The
part number sits *before* the last name segment on purpose: `sound_folder`
and every older tool tell quests from gossip by that segment, and an older
generator still running probes any file it finds under `Sounds/`.

## Automation on the owner's machine (NixOS, systemd user units)

Installed by `tools/install-timer.sh`:

- `forever-vo-ingest.path` — fires on every write of the saved-variables
  file; runs `tools/ingest.sh` = pull, ingest, push `capture.json`.
- `forever-vo-daily.timer` — 04:00 nightly: sync, voice captured lines,
  work the bulk backlog for 2 h, rebuild tables, commit and push.
- `forever-vo-bulk.service` — the long bulk run, `Restart=on-failure` so a
  CUDA context lost to suspend just resumes (existing files are skipped).
  `WantedBy=default.target` (since 2026-09-21), so a reboot resumes it on its
  own; `Restart=on-failure` only covers a crash while running, not a reboot.
  Because it is then normally up at 04:00, `daily.sh` stops it for the duration
  of the nightly run and restarts it from an `EXIT` trap — it used to just
  bail out, which would have skipped the captured pass, the table rebuild and
  the delta upload for as long as bulk stayed up. It runs `tools/bulk.sh`,
  which starts `FOREVER_VO_WORKERS` (default 1 since 2026-09-24; 2 until the
  Classic backlog finished on 2026-09-23) `generate.py --shard i/N`
  processes: one autoregressive stream leaves the GPU about 60% idle, and on
  the 3080 two together measured 2.59x realtime against 1.68x for one, while
  three were no better than two and crowd the 16 GB. One worker is the
  default now so a run that starts while the owner plays does not fight the
  client for the GPU; set `FOREVER_VO_WORKERS=2` for a big run with the game
  closed.

Do not add a periodic pull timer; the owner declined it. Parallel *shards* are
fine — `save_sound_index` merges only the keys a process wrote since its last
save (`dirty`) into the file on disk, under `flock` on POSIX or a byte-range lock
on Windows (`sound_index_lock`), and an entry never
replaces one of higher `index_rank` (a duration probed by a table rebuild is
rank 0, a generator's record with voice and fingerprint rank 3); the pack
tables and the index are written through pid-named temporary files and
renamed, and each mp3 is encoded to a `.part` file and renamed. Before
2026-09-22 the merge let each worker's whole in-memory copy win, so the
placeholders one worker probed for the other's fresh files erased the other's
voice and fingerprint: 2,790 entries lost them in two days of two-worker runs
(repaired from the journal, see `tools/repair_sound_index.py`). Two
*unsharded* generators are still wrong: they would walk the same todo list and
race for the same files.

## Releases

Three CurseForge projects, three release paths:

- **Addon** (1705010, slug `forever-vo`): `.pkgmeta` at the root uses
  `move-folders` so only `ForeverVO/` ships. Push a `v*` tag: the GitHub
  workflow builds a release with the BigWigs packager, publishes it on
  GitHub Releases and uploads it to CurseForge with the `CF_API_KEY` GitHub
  *secret* (set 2026-09-22; CurseForge's own source-linked packager never
  picked the tags up, so v0.1.2 was re-run with the secret and the log shows
  the upload succeed). The same name in the local `.env` is a different
  thing and is also set: that one is for the voice packs, below. Anything at
  the repo root not in `.pkgmeta`'s ignore list ships in the zip as a stray
  `forever-vo/` folder (CLAUDE.md did in v0.1.2), so add new root files there.
  `CHANGELOG.md` is the release notes. The packager's own dry run
  (`release.sh -d -g 1.60.1`, needs zip, unzip, pandoc) is no longer practical
  here: it walks the whole working tree, and `ForeverVO_Data/Sounds/` now holds
  thousands of mp3s, so it hangs in `find` for many minutes. CI never hits this
  because the mp3s are gitignored and the checkout has no audio. The TOC carries
  `## X-Curse-Project-ID`; the packager maps Interface 16001 to game version
  "1.60.1" itself, there is no version field to fill.
- **Delta pack** "Forever Voiceover Data: Forever" (1705094): lines whose
  source is not `classic` (captures, community, beta cache), priority 200.
  `tools/release_pack.py delta --upload --if-changed` runs at the end of the
  nightly job and uploads a dated beta when the file set changed.
- **Base packs** "Forever Voiceover Data: Base" (1705100, installs as
  `ForeverVO_Data_Base`) and "Forever Voiceover Data: Base Endgame" (project
  created 2026-09-24, ID to fill in `CURSEFORGE_PROJECTS`, installs as
  `ForeverVO_Data_Base_Endgame`; the owner's working folder `ForeverVO_Data`
  is never shipped): the Classic-sourced lines, priority 100, released by
  hand and rarely. The complete Classic set with its five alternate narrators
  is 1.36 GB at 32 kbps, and **the CurseForge website caps a file at 1 GB**
  (learned 2026-09-24 when the 1,378 MB zip was refused; the API's cap is
  lower still, `413 Payload Too Large` at 887 MB on 2026-09-22 and at 574 MB
  on 2026-09-24, while the 30
  to 70 MB delta goes through). So the set is split by quest level in
  `release_pack.py` (`BASE_SPLIT_LEVEL`): Base is quests to level 40 with all
  gossip (~800 MB), Base Endgame quests from 41 (~570 MB), each with its
  alternates, since the addon looks a quest's alternates up in the pack that
  had the quest. Cutting at 50 would put Base back over the cap; a sixth
  narrator voice costs ~65 MB per pack. Build both with `release_pack.py base`
  then `release_pack.py base_endgame` (each re-encodes its whole set, ~45 min
  together) and **upload through the website**, as "release" files for game
  version 1.60.1 (the nightly delta is a "release" file too since 2026-09-24: the CurseForge app hides
  beta files unless the user opts in). The script records
  `tools/data/release_state.json` itself even without `--upload`. The first
  Base went up 2026-09-22 before the bulk run finished, to get through
  moderation early; the split versions are dated 2026-09-24.

`release_pack.py` builds from the single working folder `ForeverVO_Data`
(which holds everything on the owner's machine and is what the client loads
locally), re-encodes to mono 32 kbps mp3 at 22.05 kHz under
`tools/data/release/` (48 kbps until 2026-09-22; the originals in
`ForeverVO_Data/Sounds/` stay at the generator's full quality, so the
release bitrate can be raised again on any later build), streams the upload
from disk (`requests-toolbelt`), writes
a fresh manifest per pack (`<Folder>Pack` global, `Register.lua`), and
uploads through the CurseForge upload API (`wow.curseforge.com/api`). Pack
versions are date based (`2026.09.20`, `.2` on the same day) and tracked in
`tools/data/release_state.json`. Project IDs are the `CURSEFORGE_PROJECTS`
constant in `tools/config.py`; the API key is `CF_API_KEY` in the
gitignored `.env`, read by `load_dotenv()` in `release_pack.py`
(`CURSEFORGE_API_KEY` is still accepted; it was renamed 2026-09-21 to match
the packager's name). This is the local file, not the GitHub secret of the
same name, which stays unset — see the addon entry above.

CurseForge moderation holds new projects and their first files for a day or
so; nothing needs doing meanwhile. The project logo must be original art
(`docs/logo.png`, a 1408x768 banner since 2026-09-22; the earlier square SVG
icon is gone); Blizzard icons are fine inside the client but rejected as a
storefront logo.

## Crowdsourcing

`/fvo export` packs a session's unvoiced lines (character name replaced by
`$n`), plus voiced lines the pack asked to hear again from a reader of the
player's sex (`wanted`), via `C_EncodingUtil` into an `FVO1:` string. Players paste it as a
comment on issue #1; `.github/workflows/ingest-captures.yml` decodes it with
`tools/exportfile.py` (stdlib only) into `captures/` and reacts with a rocket.
The owner's machine picks those up on the next sync.

## Gotchas already paid for

- A bash heredoc inside a Python heredoc terminates at the inner `EOF`. Use
  different terminators or the Write tool.
- `pkill -f 'tools/generate.py'` matches the shell that runs it; use
  `pgrep -f` to look and `systemctl --user stop forever-vo-bulk` to stop.
- A suspend can kill the GPU outright, not just the CUDA context: on
  2026-09-21 the resume logged `Xid 31` then `Xid 154, GPU recovery action
  changed to 0x2 (Node Reboot Required)`, and every later process got "CUDA
  unknown error" from `torch.cuda.is_available()` until a reboot. `nvidia-smi`
  still answers in that state, so it is not a good health check; the kernel log
  (`journalctl -k | grep Xid`) is. `generate.py` now refuses to run on the CPU
  unless `--cpu` is given, because the silent fallback is ~18x slower than real
  time and looks like a working run. The bulk unit holds a
  `systemd-inhibit --what=idle` lock, but that only stops logind's own idle
  action: GNOME's power plugin suspends on its own input-idle timer and never
  consults logind inhibitors, and it did exactly that on 2026-09-22 at 00:53
  (two hours after the last keypress, `sleep-inactive-ac-timeout` 7200) with
  the lock held, killing the GPU again. The fix is on the desktop side:
  `gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power
  sleep-inactive-ac-type 'nothing'` (set 2026-09-22; battery left at
  `suspend`). If a run dies at a round two-hour mark, check that setting first.
- The wago.tools CSV export is complete for client tables, but the beta's
  `BroadcastText` really is 12 rows; gossip is server-pushed on this engine.
- `questcache.wdb` records have a variable fixed part; `wdbcache.py` scans
  every offset and prefers the candidate with no objectives block. It parses
  all 258 records of the owner's cache and was validated against Classic
  titles.
- `PlayerModel:GetDisplayInfo()` returns 0 until the model loads; the capture
  reads it in `OnModelLoaded`, and the merge ignores zero display IDs. On the
  Forever client it never yields anything at all (0 of 146 captured NPCs), only
  `GetModelFileID()` does; the Classic export supplies display IDs for
  unchanged NPCs and the `modelFileID` fallback covers Forever-only ones. Several
  `CreatureModelData` rows can share one file (Jornah's 949470 has two), so the
  reverse index is keyed by model ID, not by file.
- `wowdata.voice_for_npc` once silently used an old field name
  (`isObjectOrItem`) and a patch whose anchor text had drifted never applied.
  After editing with search-and-replace, grep for the new text; do not trust
  "patched".
- Sound file names: quests are `<questID>-<event>`, gossip `<speaker>-<hash>`.
  Tell them apart by the last segment (`generate.sound_folder`), not by
  whether the first segment is numeric, since speaker keys are numeric too.
- Alternate narrator files keep the same base name and are told apart by their
  folder (`Quests/Narrator/<voice>/`, `Gossip/Narrator/<voice>/`), so anything
  that walks sounds by `glob("*/*.mp3")` (the two-level scan in
  `rebuild_tables`) misses them by design; they have their own scan and their
  own set in the stats (`narratorFiles`, paths relative to `Sounds/`).
- A line that stops being narrated (a capture names the giver, a species clip
  appears) leaves its whole-line alternate narrator files under
  `Narrator/<voice>/`, and the addon plays an alternate whenever the table has
  one for the quest and the player picked that voice. Since 2026-09-23
  `rebuild_tables` lists whole-line alternates only for `is_narrator` items
  and the generator deletes the leftovers (and their index entries: a dirty
  key absent from memory is removed on save). Six quests (Tarindrella, Billy
  Maclure) were already in that state.
- The bulk generator's `sound_index.json` is written every 25 files; the
  release script and the nightly table rebuild reload sources so files made
  by another run are still indexed. An entry with `v: null` and no `t` is a
  probed placeholder, not a generator record: the voice-change and
  text-change checks are blind for it. `generate.py --reindex` restamps `t`;
  the voice is only in the journal (`[voice]` on each generated line).
- `uv run --with requests python -c ...` is the way to poke at `wowdata`
  from a one-liner; `run.sh python -c` gives a bare interpreter.
- CurseForge's public web API (`curseforge.com/api/v1/...`) returns HTML to
  scripts; the authenticated `wow.curseforge.com/api` is what works.
- The Forever client picks `_Camelot.toc` when present and `.toc` otherwise;
  this addon uses the plain `.toc` with Interface 16001.

## Voices

- Race voices: `tools/voices/<race>-<gender>.wav`, cloned from NPC greeting
  kits shared by many models. Skyborne from `VocalUISounds`
  (`NormalSoundID_0` male, `_1` female). Blood elf female has only ~7 s.
- Named NPCs: `npc-<displayID>.wav` for greeting kits used by 3 or fewer
  models (64 of them: Varimathras, Thrall, Sylvanas, Cairne...). Thrall has
  just two greetings, so his clone is rougher.
- Species voices (PR #21, 2026-09-23): a speaker with no player race resolves
  through its model file (`tools/data/species_models.json`, keyed by
  `CreatureModelData.FileDataID`, which is also what `GetModelFileID()`
  returns) to `<species>-<gender>.wav` when the clip exists. The clips come
  from Warcraft III: `extract_wc3_units.py` reads the local Reforged install
  through CascLib (built from source, `tools/data/libcasc.so`, gitignored;
  build steps at the top of the script) into `tools/voices/raw-wc3/units/`,
  and `build_wc3_references.py` cuts the "what"/"yes" acknowledgements into
  dryad, keeper of the grove, ogre, satyr, banshee, dreadlord, flesh golem,
  dire troll and naga clips. The two child voices come from retail's
  `kul_tiran_kid` via `build_retail_references.py`. Built 2026-09-23; the
  voice-change check then regenerated ~514 lines.
- `FALLBACK_VOICES` and `ZONE_RACE_HINTS` in `tools/config.py` cover races
  without a clip and speakers without display data (Zephras Isle -> skyborne).
- `--assume-voice` on `generate.py` voices cache-only quests whose giver is
  unknown (used once for Zephras Isle with `skyborne-male`); the voice-change
  check fixes them once a capture names the giver.
- `NARRATOR_VOICES` remains an upstream generation option. This fork always
  plays the default narration; it does not expose a narrator picker or read the
  old `ForeverVO_narratorVoice` CVar. Use `--narrator-voices none` for this fork.
- The talking head always uses quest parchment with dark body/title text.
  There is no background selector. NPC greetings and conversations always play
  when available; the internal queue deduplicates pending audio and gives quest
  dialogue priority. The old repeat-frequency and dialogue toggles are unused.

## Things the owner wants next

- Per-line configurability: let end users nudge text, voice, exaggeration or
  pacing for a line and re-run Chatterbox for it themselves.
- A Discord bot as an alternative inbox for `FVO1:` strings (same decoder).
- A complete base pack release once the Classic bulk run finishes (the first,
  partial one went up 2026-09-22 with ~12,900 of ~18,000 files; the alternate
  narrator voices were all still to come).
