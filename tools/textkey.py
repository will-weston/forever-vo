"""Text normalisation and hashing, byte-for-byte identical to Util.Tokenize /
Util.NormalizeText / Util.HashText in ForeverVO/Core/Util.lua. The addon looks
gossip lines up by this key, so the two implementations must never drift.

The client resolves $n, $c and $r against whoever is reading before any addon
sees the text, so captured text says "Myrlin" and "rogue" where the database
says $n and $c. Both sides drop all three, so a line matches whoever reads it.
