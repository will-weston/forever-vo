"""Builds cloning references from Warcraft III unit audio.

Some speakers have no recorded voice anywhere in World of Warcraft. A dryad, a
keeper of the grove, an ogre or a human child has a model and a name but its
sound kit is grunts and roars, so it ends up borrowing a human's voice - or the
narrator's, which is worse. Warcraft III voiced those same units properly, and
a player who owns it has the files locally.

Extract the units folder from the CASC storage first: extract_wc3_units.py does
it from a local Reforged install through CascLib (Ladik's CascView works too),
and this script reads its output folder by default:

    ./tools/run.sh tools/extract_wc3_units.py
    ./tools/run.sh tools/build_wc3_references.py --dry-run
    ./tools/run.sh tools/build_wc3_references.py --only dryad --only ogre
    python tools/build_wc3_references.py --src "C:/Users/you/Downloads/wc3-units"

Writes tools/voices/<species>.wav, which voice_for_npc picks up by name the same
way as a race voice.

Two filters matter. "Pissed" lines are the joke responses to repeated clicking -
in character but played for laughs, and wrong in a quest. Combat calls (attack,
warcry, death) are shouted rather than spoken. What remains - the "what" and
"yes" acknowledgements - is the unit talking normally, which is what a quest
giver should sound like.
