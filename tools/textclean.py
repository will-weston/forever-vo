# $c (the player's class) renders as "adventurer" like $n, which has two known
# faults: a line carrying both says "adventurer" twice, and "adventurer" is
# vowel-initial, so the 74 lines written "a $c" ("I cannot train a $c such as
# yourself") come out "a adventurer". "friend" fixes both -- consonant-initial,
# what Classic NPCs actually call you, and correct in every position the corpus
# uses -- at the cost of 2 possessive lines ("your first friend's robes").
#
# Deliberately NOT changed yet: 1,246 lines carry $c and 318 of them already
# have audio, so swapping the word costs ~1.1 h of GPU that the first full
# generation needs more. The fingerprints are seeded (generate.py --reindex), so
# whenever this changes, `generate.py --stale-only` finds exactly the affected
# files by itself. Revisit once the bulk backlog is done.
#
# One word for everyone either way: the audio is rendered once, so a per-player
# choice would mean a full extra copy of every $c line (~1,270 files, ~4.6 h)
# per option, and the word cannot be spliced in at runtime -- the client only
# has PlaySoundFile, and the clip would need to exist in each of the ~38 cloned
# voices to match the line around it.

# Respellings for names Chatterbox gets wrong. The model takes plain text only
# (no IPA or SSML), so the fix is spelling the word the way it should sound.
# Whole words, any case; a shouted all-caps word stays all caps. Changing an
# entry changes the spoken-text fingerprint, so `generate.py --stale-only`
# regenerates exactly the affected files. Try candidates by ear first: of five
# for Gnomeregan (/noʊmɹəˈgɑːn/), "Nomer-gahn" was natural, "Gnome-ruh-gahn"
# was bad, and "Nome-ruh-GAHN" came out partly as numbers (so do not mark stress
# with capitals). Ahn'Qiraj is fine as written; "Ahn Kih-rahj" adds a rolled r.
# Quel'Thalas came out wrong; "Quell Thalas" and "Kwel-thalas" were both fine.
# Kharanos as written varies take to take, and so do "Karanos" and "Karra-noss"
# (each had bad takes out of four); "Karranos" was fine all four times, sometimes
# with a Scottish rolled r. Dun Morogh is fine as written; one bad take in game
# ("Muro-h") was a bad sample, fixed by regenerating the file. Tirisfal as
# written sometimes came out "Tirefal"; "Tirrisfal" and "Teerisfall" were right
# four times of four. Hyphens can leave a pause mid-word ("Teer-iss-fall",
# "Tirriss-fall"), so prefer respellings without them. Varimathras as written
# was only ever ok or good; "Vairimathrus" was good four times of four.
