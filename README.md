# Forever Voiceover

## Native voice-profile fork

This fork includes the local IndexTTS 2.5 generation workflow, NPC voice-family
profiles, simplified settings, a static portrait with quest-style playback
controls, an independent queue window, and the speech-bubble minimap icon.
The current local pack covers 187 quests with 483 recordings across Tirisfal,
Mulgore, Silverpine, and related class/delivery chains.

**This repository contains source code and pack metadata, not the generated
audio.** MP3s, reference recordings, model weights, environments, local captures,
and backups are kept outside Git. Downloading the source alone does not install
the voiced pack. A player release must include both `ForeverVO/` and the matching
`ForeverVO_Data/` audio files.

The current generation method is documented in
[the voice recipe](docs/voice-audition-recipe.md); the Windows workspace is
documented in [WINDOWS_SETUP.md](WINDOWS_SETUP.md). Historical audition reports
contain links to local artifacts and are not portable build instructions.
The existing UI smoke harness is available as `tools/ui_smoke_test.lua` and runs
under Lua 5.1 from the repository root. Existing capture-boundary checks run with
`python tools/test_local_safety.py` in the configured tools environment.

## Upstream project

Voiced quests and NPC dialogue for World of Warcraft: Forever, with audio you
generate yourself from a local text-to-speech model.

**The quest text for Forever additions is crowd sourced, please help out by downloading the addon and occasionally running `/fvo export`**. 

Three addons on CurseForge: the player, and two voice packs that stack.

- **[Forever Voiceover](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/forever-voiceover)**
  (`ForeverVO`) — the player, and the only one you need to start. Reads quest
  offers, turn-ins, greetings and gossip from installed voice packs and plays
  them through a talking-head frame styled after the client's own, with a queue
  you can pause, skip and reorder, and a replay button on each quest you open in
  the quest log. It also records every line it sees so new audio can be
  generated for what is still missing.
- **[Forever Voiceover Data: Base](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/forever-voiceover-data-base)**
  (`ForeverVO_Data`, priority 100) — the Classic lines. Big, and updated almost
  never: this is text that has not changed since Classic, so once a line is
  voiced it stays voiced. Install it once and forget it.
- **[Forever Voiceover Data: Forever](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/forever-voiceover-data-forever)**
  (`ForeverVO_Data_Forever`, priority 200) — everything Forever adds or
  rewrites. Small, and updated often, especially when new content drops: these
  are the lines being crowd sourced, so it grows as players run `/fvo export`.
  Its higher priority means it overrides the base pack wherever both have a
  line.

Install either pack, both, or neither — the player works on its own, it just has
nothing to say until a pack is there.

Built for the Forever client only (Camelot, interface 16001). It uses the
Retail engine APIs: the Settings panel, the addon compartment, mixins, frame
pools. No embedded libraries.

## How it works

Quest and gossip text is not in the client files; the server sends it. So the
addon captures text as you play, and the tools turn the captured lines into
audio:

1. Play. Every quest you accept or hand in and every NPC you talk to is
   recorded in `ForeverVOCaptureDB`, with the speaker's creature ID and model.
2. Log out, then `./tools/run.sh tools/ingest.py` merges the saved
   variables into `tools/data/capture.json`.
3. `./tools/run.sh tools/generate.py` picks a voice per speaker (race and
   gender from the client's display tables), synthesises the missing lines with
   Chatterbox on your GPU, and rebuilds the pack tables.
4. Restart the client (new sound files are only seen at launch) and play on.

The beta client currently does not read saved variables back at login, so run
`ingest.py` after every session; the `.bak` file gives one session of slack.

## Voice pack format

A pack is an addon that depends on ForeverVO and calls
`ForeverVO.RegisterPack(pack)`; see `ForeverVO_Data/Data/Pack.lua` and the
comment at the top of `ForeverVO/Core/Packs.lua`. Quest audio is keyed by quest
ID and event; gossip by speaker ID plus a hash of the normalised text
(`tools/textkey.py` mirrors `Util.HashText`), with a fuzzy fallback. Packs have
priorities, so a pack of new or revised lines can sit on top of a base pack.

## Setup

Scripts declare their own dependencies in inline metadata and run with
[`uv run`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/); `tools/run.sh` wraps
that and, on NixOS, also supplies Python, ffmpeg and the shared libraries the
CUDA wheels expect. Elsewhere, `uv run tools/<script>.py` works directly with
`ffmpeg` on PATH.

```bash
./tools/run.sh tools/tts_smoke.py            # CUDA check, writes tools/smoke.wav
./tools/run.sh tools/build_voice_references.py   # reference clips from the client's own voice lines

B="$HOME/Faugus/battlenet/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/World of Warcraft/_classic_beta_/Interface/AddOns"
ln -s "$PWD/ForeverVO" "$B/ForeverVO"
ln -s "$PWD/ForeverVO_Data" "$B/ForeverVO_Data"
```

Provide `tools/voices/narrator.wav` (10 to 20 s of clean speech) for quests and
gossip from items and objects. Those lines are generated again in each voice in
`config.NARRATOR_VOICES`, under `Sounds/<Quests|Gossip>/Narrator/<voice>/`, so
players can pick the narrator they prefer in the options. The extra passes sort after
every line that has no audio at all; `--narrator-voices none` leaves them out
of a run and `--narrator-only` makes a run of nothing else.

## In game

- `/fvo` opens the options. `/fvo pause|resume|skip|clear|replay|queue|head|reset|narrator|status|debug`.
- The narrator reads the lines with no speaker to voice them: quests and
  chatter from objects, items and signs. Options > Audio > Narrator voice picks
  which voice that is, from whatever the pack carries; `/fvo narrator` cycles.
- Right-click the talking head to skip; the X clears the queue; "Queue" shows
  what is waiting; drag to move (lockable in options).
- The addon compartment entry (next to the minimap) has the same controls.
- Opening a quest in the quest log puts a Play button beside Back, for quests
  that have audio.

## Contributing lines

Quest and gossip text only exists on the server, so the pack can only grow
from what players see. With the addon on, play (the new zones matter most),
then type `/fvo export`, press Ctrl+C, and paste the string as a comment on
the pinned issue: https://github.com/quinn-dougherty/forever-vo/issues/1.
A bot decodes it into `captures/` and the next pack build voices it. Your
character name is removed before export.
